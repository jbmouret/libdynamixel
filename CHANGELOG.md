- [New model] Add (almost complete) support for the servo-motors in the X series

## March, 26th 2018

- [Improvement] Add support to MX series using protocol 2
- [API change] rename control table fields:
  - _original: new_
  - d_gain: position_d_gain
  - i_gain: position_i_gain
  - p_gain: position_p_gain
  - current: present_current
  - sensed_current: present_current
  - control_mode: operating_mode

## March, 2nd 2018

- [Improvement] `operating_mode` functions to get the operating mode (position or velocity) of servo-motors
- [API change] the operating mode (wheel or joint) is now defined as a scoped enum, thus used like `dynamixel::OpertingMode::wheel`
- [Deprecation] removed method `get_goal_speed_angle` that only duplicated `get_moving_speed` and brought nothing
- [API change] renamed methods `reg_goal_speed_angle` and `set_goal_speed_angle` respectively to `reg_moving_speed_angle` and `set_moving_speed_angle`
- [Improvement] add information on the unit in error message for position and speed limit overflow
- [Command line] allow to set timeout for the scan for connected servos
- [Command line] catch exceptions raised by boost::program_options when improper options are used
- [Improvement] the UnpackError tells the user how many bytes arrived and were expected

## July, 13th 2017

- [API change] (addition) `auto_detect` `and auto_detect_map` now have an optional (function overload) second argument: a `std::vector` of `Protocol::id_t` (servo ID); if this argument is provided, the library will only scan for the desired IDs
- [Improvement] command line utility uses the above functionality to dramatically reduce response time when IDs are provided.
