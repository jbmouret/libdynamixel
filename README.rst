libdynamixel
============
libdynamixel is a C++11, header-only interface to the `Dynamixel <http://en.robotis.com/index/product.php?cate_code=101010>`_ actuators that aims at being lightweight and highly flexible. This library is NOT the `official dynamixel SDK provided by Robotis <https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK>`_, but it provides a similar service.

This library is for Unix-like systems (GNU/Linux and Mac OSX)

We also provide a simple command-line tool that allows to change the IDs, the baudrate, the control mode, the position, etc.

Main features
===============

* Support for Dynamixel series AX, MX, EX, XL and Pro
* Support for all instructions and messages of both version 1 and 2 of the Dynamixel communication protocol (including torque control, speed control, etc.)
* Full C++11 API
* An optional ROS interface (hardware interface) is available in a separate repository (`dynamixel_control_hw <https://github.com/resibots/dynamixel_control_hw/>`_).

==============
The full documentation (including tutorials, guides, and API) is available on the `ResiBots website <http://www.resibots.eu/libdynamixel>`_

This library is used in most of the robots designed in ERC project `ResiBots <http://www.resibots.eu/photos.html>`_ (funded by the European Research Council), in particular :

* several 18-DOFs hexapod robots (based on MX-28 actuators);
* a mobile manipulator based on Dynamixel Pro actuators and the Kuka Youbot (omnidirectionnal platform);
* a wheel-legged hybrid robot (based on MX-128 actuators);
* several small arms (based on Crustcrawler kits and MX actuators).

*We would be pleased to hear from you if you use this library in one of your projects.*

Building
========
Dependencies :

* python2.x
* C++
* Boost C++

.. highlight:: shell

The build system for this library is Waf. Don't run away yet. It has the big advantage of requiring no more than Python installed on your computer. If you run a GNU/Linux OS or Mac OS, you should already have it. Here is how we compile and install it:

1. configuration
    run ``./waf configure`` and add ``--prefix PATH/TO/INSTALL`` if you want to install it to a specific location
2. compilation
    is as easy as ``./waf``
3. installation
    is simply done with ``./waf install``, with the required rights (might need sudo if you install globally)
4. setup the proper authorisation
    please ensure that you have the proper rights to access the serial interfaces. On GNU/Linux, you might have to add your user to the `dialout` group and log out.

You get the ``dynamixel`` toolset and the demo programms compiled in the ``build/default/src`` folder.

Support
=======
This library is actively used and regularly developped. If you need some help, feel free to `fill an issue <https://github.com/resibots/libdynamixel/issues/new>`_ on this repository. We'll do our best to be responsive.

Alternative software
====================

* Inria FLOWERS team developped `pybot <http://poppy-project.github.io/poppy-docs/pypot/doc/index.html>`_, a python library to control a Dynamixel-based robot.
* The official `Robotis SDK <https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK>`_.
